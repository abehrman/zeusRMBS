mortgage backed security pricing library

I was working through [The Mortgage Backed Securities Workbook by Andrew Davidson](https://www.amazon.com/Mortgage-Backed-Securities-Workbook-Andrew-Davidson/dp/0578148153/ref=sr_1_12?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1414093370&sr=1-12) and put together this library.

It serves as a utility for bond and mortgage valuation calculations, and have functionality for displaying interactive charts.

Ultimately, I ended up using these tools to build a quick and dirty web interface that is no longer running.
